# Project One:- Random Quote Generator
 <h2>Motivation</h2>
 <p>This project has been created as part of the TreeHouse course modules for Full Stack Javascript. The idea is to create a Random Quote generator using Javascript.</p>
 <p>The Random Quote Generator must have the following included.</p>
 <ol>
 <li>Create an array of objects to store data for your quotes</li>
 <li>Add data to your quote strings
    <ol>
        <li>quote - <i>string</i> - the actual quote</li>
        <li>source - <i>string</i> - the person or character who said it</li> 
        <li>Add a citation property to at least one quote object</li>
        <li>Add a year property to at least one quote object</li>
    </ol>
 </li>
 <li></li>
 </ol>
